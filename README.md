# NuWCRU-- Does fluctuating selection maintain variation in nest defense behavior in Arctic peregrine falcons (_Falco peregrinus tundrius_)?

## Project Description
Within populations, individuals often exhibit repeatable among-individual differences in behavior, and in some cases, these are linked to different fitness outcomes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the maintenance of repeatable amongindividual variation in behavior. Here we study nest defense behavior in Arctic peregrine falcons (_Falco peregrinus tundrius_) over two successive breeding seasons (2018 and 2019) to evaluate the importance of two potential mechanisms that could underlie the maintenance of among-individual variation in this trait; assortative mating and fluctuating selection. Nest defense was measured as the response made by peregrines towards human observers during standard nest visits; high nest defense was characterized by close approaches to the observer, and low nest defense was characterized by maintaining greater distance from the observer. Nest defense scores ranged from 0m (i.e., contact with observer) to 600m.
